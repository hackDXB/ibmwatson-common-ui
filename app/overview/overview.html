            <h2>Using the common styles</h2>
            <p>The common styles are built into the ibmwatson.css file, so you will need to include this in your index.html.  Add the "watson" class to the body element, and the styles will be available.</p>
            <p>The CSS is designed to apply to the semantic HTML elements as far as possible, so if you use the correct HTML elements you will automatically pick up the styles.</p>
